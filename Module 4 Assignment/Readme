A dataset containing various attributes on Netflix movies and shows was downloaded and stored

There are 2 scripts of Python and R code that are being used for data manipulation. Some of the libraries that are being used include pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, amongst others
The data that is being analysed is about movies or content for Netflix
A number of data related operations have been applied as per assignment to include descriptive statistics as well other statistics on the data
Thereafter, Python and R have been used to create different graphs as required within the exercise

For thr R script- packages such as ggplot2, fs, dplyr, etc have also been utilised

These packages need to first be installed within the respective development environments
