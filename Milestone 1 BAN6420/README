This work has been prepared by Albert Murungi as a submission for an academic assignment to Nexford University and it is solely for academic purposes at this stae. 
1. #Class Creation

Three (3) separate classes were created for policyholders, products, and payments. Each of the classes was saved as a seperate file. 

The %run command was used to execute the respective files in the main_policydemonstration file where the different classes and methods created were instantiated

2. #Policyholder Management:

Various methods were imolemented to register, suspend, and reactivate policyholders.

3. #Payment Management:

Various methods were also implemented for payment processing, reminders, and penalties.

4. #Product Management:

Additional methods were implemented for creating, updating, and removing/suspending policy products.

5. #Policyholder Demonstration:

Finally at least two policyholders who have paid for one of the products were created and their account details displayed.

6. Error handling techniques were applied using various ways such as use of validation checks with if statements, try, except and finally blocks.

7. The inheritance technique was also utilise to make the code more reusable and extensible. For instance the poliyholders class inherited the person base class attributes
