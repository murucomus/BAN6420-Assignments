1. A Flask web application has been created for data collection

2. Using AWS EC2, we have hosted the MongoDB on AWS EC2 instance and accessed it via its public dns address, ie, ec2-54-198-162-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com:27017/
3. The MongoDB is used to store user data, including the specified details and expense categories.
5. Once some sample data is added to the MongoDB via the form created, it is extracted into a csv file for processing
5. A Python class named "User" is then used for data processing user data.

6. We loop through the collected data and store it in a CSV file.

7. The CSV file is then loaded into a Jupyter notebook for data analysis.

8. 2 visualizations have been made from the data and these include;
#The ages with the highest income.
#The gender distribution across spending categories
9. The charts are then saved for use in a presentation using the savefig python function

10. To host the Flask application on AWS- I created an account on AWS, and set up an Ubuntu instance. A public key is created to enable connection to the instance
- Using the ElasticBeanstalk CLI i make a number of configurations on the AWS instance to ensure our flask applications works well
- I use ssh to connect to the ubuntu on the EC2 instance on AWS via the provided public IP
- I install a MongoDB on ubuntu and then make a connection to our application client
-Tests are made to ensure that the connection to the DB is working well
