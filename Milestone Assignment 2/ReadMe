In this project a number of librararies were used to achieve the assignment including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, amongst others
Additionally the following were accomplished; 
A. I implemented a principle component analysis technique (PCA) using the cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets. This was
intended to reduce the dimensionality of the data set to make easier for use by the prediction model.
B. The breast cancer dataset was therefore reduced into 2 PCA components.
C. The data was standardised before feature selection (PCA) and also before being split into a training and testing dataset
D. The logistic regression model was trained using standardised data and thereafter the model was tested
E. THe logistic regression model was then used to predict between malignant and benign cancer and corresponding class labels for benign and malignant cansers
F. The performance of the model was thereafter tested for accuracy and other techniques such as confusion matrix and classification report were also applied to test the level of 
The model was found to have an accuracy level of 97%
